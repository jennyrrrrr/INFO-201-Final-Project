# INFO-201-Final-Project
This is the Project Mary. We will be looking at how malnutrition rates relate to the importation and exportation quantities for each country. In order to do this, we will be analyzing data sets pertaining to malnutrition and trade. We will then use information we discover through our analyses to ask questions pertaining to our project problem.
