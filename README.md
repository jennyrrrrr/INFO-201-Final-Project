# INFO-201-Final-Project
This is the Project Mary. We will be looking at why societies have so much food waste while others go hungry. In order to do this, we will be analyzing data sets pertaining to food waste, hunger, and agriculture. We will then use information we discover through our analyses to ask questions pertaining to our project problem.
